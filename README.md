# Watchlist

This repository contains the sources of the watchlist application for Sailfish OS.

At the moment there are two backends that provide the data. There are the public
rest services that the page https://www.euroinvestor.dk/ uses. The other backend is
the offical Moscow Exchange API backend. In the future i plan
to support more backend, e.g. Deutsche Boerse, so you can get more stocks for your
specific market country.

## Features

- Watchlist with stocks from all over the world.
- Add / Remove stocks
- Update Quotes
- Add alarms to individual stocks
- Two different data backend (Euroinvestor / Moscow Exchange)
